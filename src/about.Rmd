## Hi, I'm Nils

![](me.jpg)

and this is my personal blog. Here, I will occasionally post thoughts
on random topics concerning programming languages data modeling or
whatever comes to mind.

Besides my recreational interest in programming, I work as a
data scientist and did some [more serious
research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=iLErbK0AAAAJ)
applying methods from complex systems science and information theory
to computational neuroscience, Bayesian data analysis and financial
markets.
