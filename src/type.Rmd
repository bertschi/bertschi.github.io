# What's in a type?

Types are one of the most fundamental abstractions in programming
languages. Originally, the need of types arises from the need to store
different *kinds/types* of data, e.g., integers or characters, in the
computer's memory. Yet, in memory all bits are equal and thus the
notion of type is needed to correctly *interpret* the bits at a
particular memory location.

To this end, types can either be tracked at compile time, i.e., the
compiler tracks or infers the type of each expression based on
syntatic information alone and generates code containing the machine
instructions suitable for each type. This approach is commonly known
as *static typing* and has the advantage that type based optimizations
can be incorporated into the compiler. Furthermore, no runtime
representation of type information -- adding additional overheads to
the generated code -- is required.

In contrast, *dynamic typing* explicitly represents type information
along with each value. This has the advantage that type information is
available during the execution of a programm allowing for powerful
reflective facilities. The distinction between static and dynamic
typing has been debated extensively -- including many flame wars --
and I will not add to this debate here, but instead consider
alternative materializations and uses of types.

*Mental model*

More formally, a type can be considered as a set of possible values,
i.e., integer denoting the possible numeric values $\{\ldots, -2, -1,
0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$ or character denoting $\{a, b, c, \ldots, A, B, C,
\ldots\}$. This idea serves as a useful *mental model* for
understanding types in many programming languages[^mm]. In particular,
several relationships between different types follow rather naturally
from this model:

[^mm]: While this models covers types in many programming languages,
    it does not facefully respresent all uses/notions of types. In
    particular, classes in OOP languages are often not types according
    to this model, especially when [multiple
    inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance)
    is involved.

* *Subtyping*: A type $T$ is a subtype of $S$ iff $T \subseteq S$,
  i.e., the set of possible values of $T$ is a subset of the possible
  values of $S$ or stated differently, every possible value of $T$ is
  also a value of $S$.
  
* *Liskov substitution principle*:

  > Let $\phi (x)$ be a property provable about objects $x$ of type
  > $T$. Then $\phi (y)$ should be true for objects $y$ of type $S$ where
  > $S$ is a subtype of $T$.

The Liskov substitution principle has since been popularized as an
important design principle in OOP. In this context, following this
principle ensures that classes essentially obey the mental model of
types as sets of values. Furthermore, it enables generic programming,
i.e., ensuring that subtypes can by substituted whenever a desired
behavior is defined for a supertype. For that reason, it is also known
as *behavioral subtyping*.

Now, with a suitable mental model in place, let us explore several
uses of types in Julia or similar languages[^julia].

[^julia]: Here, I choose Julia as an example since its type system
    supports several operations on types. In particular, user-defined
    bit types and ad-hoc polymorphism is readily supported. Other
    languages, e.g., C++, Common Lisp or Haskell, would work as well.

## Other uses of types

*Physical types*

As already mentioned, an important use of types is the interpretation
of bits in memory. This can be referred to as a *physical* notion of
type. Furthermore, all bit types are *concrete types*, i.e., each of
their possible values is inhabited and represented by some bit
sequence as existing in the physical memory.

```julia
julia> u = 0x10FF  # Hexadecimal number
0x10ff

julia> typeof(u)  # Its type 
UInt16

julia> bitstring(u)  # Bits of that number
"0001000011111111"

julia> reinterpret(Int16, u)  # Same bits interpreted as signed integer
4351

julia> reinterpret(Float16, u)  # Same bits interpreted as IEEE float
Float16(0.00061)
```

Thus, the physical type allows to interpret the bits in memory and
thereby ensures that operations on the values represented by them work
as desired:

```julia
julia> mul(x, y) = x * y
mul (generic function with 1 method)

julia> @code_llvm mul(1, 2)
;  @ REPL[51]:1 within `mul`
define i64 @julia_mul_675(i64 signext %0, i64 signext %1) #0 {
top:
; ┌ @ int.jl:88 within `*`
   %2 = mul i64 %1, %0
; └
  ret i64 %2
}

julia> @code_llvm mul(1.0, 2.0)
;  @ REPL[51]:1 within `mul`
define double @julia_mul_677(double %0, double %1) #0 {
top:
; ┌ @ float.jl:385 within `*`
   %2 = fmul double %0, %1
; └
  ret double %2
}
```

Note that different LLVM machine instructions are emitted, depending
on whether the inputs are to be considered as integer or floating
point numbers. In general, every compiler must generate code with
different instructions as the hardware is usually not distinguishing
between bits of different types.

*Logical types*

Another important use of types is to express behavioral properties at
a more abstract level. I.e., all number types should support
meaningful operations such as addition or multiplication. In Julia
this allows the function `mul` from above to work on any concrete type
implementing a suitable `*` operation.

```julia
julia> mul("Hello", "world")  # Yes, strings can be multiplied as well
"Helloworld"
```

This is also known as *ad-hoc polymorphism*, i.e., the same operation
can be implemented differently for different types. In this context, a
distinction between *nominal* and *structural* typing is made. Whereas
structural typing only requires that the required operations are
implemented for the concrete type actually used, nominal typing
requires an explicit logical type for the operation to be allowed. In
Julia both versions can be used:

```{marginfigure}
Note that the distinction between nominal and structural typing is orthogonal
to the one between static and dynamic typing. Most dynamic languages allow structural
typing, while most static languages require nominal typing though.
```

```julia
julia> struct_mul(x, y) = x * y
struct_mul (generic function with 1 method)

julia> struct_mul(1, 2)  # Works, as * is defined for integers
2

julia> struct_mul("Ha", "ha")  # Works as * is defined for strings
"Haha"
```

Structural typing is also known as *duck typing* as any type that
"walks like a duck and quacks like a duck" can be considered to "be a
duck". Here, the types `Int64` and `String` both support the `*`
operation and can thus be used as inputs for `struct_mul`.

```julia
julia> nom_mul(x::Real, y::Real) = x * y
nom_mul (generic function with 1 method)

julia> nom_mul(1, 2)
2

julia> nom_mul("Hu", "hu")
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching nom_mul(::String, ::String)
Stacktrace:
 [1] top-level scope
   @ REPL[62]:1
```

Now, the function `nom_mul` is only applicable for some subtype of
`Real`. Here, `Real` is a logical or abstract type, i.e., it has
several explicit subtypes:

```julia
julia> using AbstractTrees

julia> AbstractTrees.children(d::DataType) = subtypes(d)

julia> print_tree(Real)
Real
├─ AbstractFloat
│  ├─ BigFloat
│  ├─ Float16
│  ├─ Float32
│  └─ Float64
├─ AbstractIrrational
│  └─ Irrational
├─ Integer
│  ├─ Bool
│  ├─ Signed
│  │  ├─ BigInt
│  │  ├─ Int128
│  │  ├─ Int16
│  │  ├─ Int32
│  │  ├─ Int64
│  │  └─ Int8
│  └─ Unsigned
│     ├─ UInt128
│     ├─ UInt16
│     ├─ UInt32
│     ├─ UInt64
│     └─ UInt8
└─ Rational
```

In Julia, only abstract types can have subtypes and every type has
exactly one supertype with `Any` at the top of the hierarchy. In
contrast to the mental model, the subtype relation is not based on the
subset relation between possible values -- which would be intractable
to check in practice -- but needs to be defined explicitly via `T <:
S` when defining the type $T$. This explicit subtyping provides a
powerful means to state generic functions, i.e., which can operate on
several types sharing common behavior. In this respect, the type
`Real` expresses that its values logically adhere to the concept of
being real numbers[^real].

[^real]: Note that abstract types are not inhabited by any concrete
    values, i.e., as represented by actual bit sequences. Instead,
    they can be thought of as the union of all concrete types which
    are direct or indirect subtypes.

Thus, compared to structural typing, nominal typing is more explicit
in which types are allowed. Thereby, required operations and there
properties can be expressed and documented more explicitly. Any code
using a logical type can then assume that all documented operations
for it are available and furthermore, behave in a particular way. For
the more mathemtically inclined, the notion of a *monoid* would be a
good candidate for a logical type:

* Type $T$ is a monoid if it supports two operations, namely `one ::
  T` and `* :: T x T -> T`.
  
* Furthermore, the following properties need to hold:

  `one` is left and right unit to `*`, i.e., `one * x == x == x * one`
	 
  `*` is associative, i.e., `(x * y) * z == x * (y * z)`

In Haskell, the monoid concept is explicitly expressed as a *type
class*. Here, type classes correspond to logical types -- nominally
expressing their required behaviors -- which in turn can be
implemented by several types -- providing the actual behaviors on
concrete types. In contrast to Julia, Haskell enforces nominal typing
and accordingly ad-hoc polymorphism is more controlled, e.g., requires
the use of type classes or similar means.

In Julia, only some concepts such as `Real`, `Integer` or
`AbstractVector` are explicitly specified and accordingly require
explicit subtyping to enable the use of generic functions on new
types[^foo].
