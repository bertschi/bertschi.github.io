# What's in a type?

Many facets of types

*Mental model*

Type as set of possible values:

* most general, but not always applicable, i.e., classes

* natural laws, i.e., subtyping and Liskov substitution principle

## Other uses of types

*Physical* representation of data in memory, i.e., concrete types.

*Logical* properties, i.e., supported operations. Abstractions for generic programming.

*Type theory*: Syntactic tag, i.e., restricting range of syntactically
valid programs. Ideally, such programs will run without errors.

*Domain thinking*: Types for documentation and static correctness, i.e., `Email` or [safe strings](https://blog.moertel.com/posts/2006-10-18-a-type-based-solution-to-the-strings-problem.html)

*Missing types*: Shape in tensor computations or dimensions/units in
physical simulations.
